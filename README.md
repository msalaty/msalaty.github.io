Mayamba Salaty, msalaty@my.waketech.edu
My Github account name is msalaty, it has a profile picture of an anime character holding a sword and he is covered in red and black flames. My full name should also be on the profile which is Mayamba Salaty. 
Well, all I did to create another repository was download and attach a snake picture. 
I started by opening up the GitHub application then when I did I logged in and entered my details. Then I selected my backup hard drive for school and threw the file inside my folder for this class.
